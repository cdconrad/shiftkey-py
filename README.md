====WELCOME TO SHIFTKEY-PY: BUILD A TWITTER PROFILER====

This is a Python tutorial designed to introduce senior students
to Python programming with Django. The motivation behind this tutorial is
that senior students often have the ability to learn things on their own,
but could use a hand learning things faster. In this tutorial, I will teach
you the Django stack... which is everything you need to win a Hackathon or
build your first professional web application. The tutorial is designed to
teach some key concepts in Python, HTML/CSS and Django quite quickly using
concrete examples each week for 5 weeks. Each example will be
designed in a way that students can modify the file to add additional
functionality. Material from each week is provided in a folder along
side some written documentation. There is also a challenge in each folder...
if you can complete each challenge on your own, you are probably able to
develop Django do this professionally (though not necessarily masterfully).

This tutorial is very much a work in progress and is designed to be used by both
the Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie, and the wider community. For the
2017 run through, we will be collaborating with the students from CSCI 2133 and
adding more content each week.
